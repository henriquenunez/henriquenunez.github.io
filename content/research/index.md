My research is in process monitoring for Directed Energy Deposition, and
Additive Manufacturing process. Those who are familiar know that this process is
currently lacking quality, so here is where my research enters.

I have developed a 3D voxel visualizer to perform a quality inspection of the
printed parts, and have a non-destructive analysis.

Lately, I have been employing Machine Learning through CNNs to predict several
process variables using a coaxial camera that points to the melt pool, where the
metal gets molten.

Also, I am collaborating with [Professor Samuel Oliveira](https://oliveiralab.me) in analyzing microbial communities in microfluidic chips with microscopy imaging.
