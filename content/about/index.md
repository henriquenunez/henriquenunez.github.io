My name is Hiram, and I am a Computer Scientist, born and raised in Brazil. I am
a software developer and researcher, quite interested in machine learning and
robotics. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Finland in Robotics and
Autonomous Systems.

My research focus until now has been in Directed Energy Deposition monitoring,
an area that aims for a better process control and broader adoption for this
amazing manufacturing process.

My personal projects reflect my interests: a lot of cool stuff, related to
embedded systems, computer vision and IoT.

My resume can be accessed via [this link](/resume.pdf). You can get in touch if you want, just ping me on Telegram or send me an e-mail.
