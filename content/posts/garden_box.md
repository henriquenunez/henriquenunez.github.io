Upon moving to a larger house, it was natural for me to build a vegetable garden and I wanted something to water my plants for me, because in a period of the year there is basically no rain in southeastern Brazil and I am a programmer, so I am lazy. Since I am solarpunk, it is powered by a solar panel.

## Irrigation

Simple, just connect a solenoid

## Make it (un)simple

I wouldn't be able to just get away with an irrigation system, so I wanted to increase the level of difficulty because yes. So I created more requirements:

- Gate activator
- Weather station
- Security camera power supply

## High level schematics

- TODO: put them here

## 3D modelling

Yes, we need a box, because it is a garden box. So I designed a 3D printed box to contain the electronics so the rain wouldn't destroy it.
