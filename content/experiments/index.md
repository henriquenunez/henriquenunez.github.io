I like the idea of biohacking, so I am experimenting with myself.

## Pharmacy:

I am currently testing L-Methylfolate (360mg/day) after finding out I have a mutation in the MTHFR gene that reduces the efficiency of the enzyme that converts B9 into an useful compound;

## Photobiomodulation:

I have a red + near IR light panel that I use to heal my skin and grow my muscles. It allegedly boosts mythocondrial activity, and helps in renuvenating and repairing living tissues. In the literature, it has been shown to help with:
- Hair loss
- Skin lesions
- Muscular pain
- Fat loss
